Programming languages

I selected the Wildlife Zoo project. The purpose was to write a program using both Java and C++.Doing so I wrote a user menu tp select a handfull of options. When the generate data option was selected it allowed code from Java to be used in C++, using the createzoo method. There is also a save and load option along with a add and remove animal option.
I feel like the menu works nice, but what im most proud of is the save and load mthods. I have few experiences in those so getting them to work and work well was a nice achievment. 
I would definitly enhance the DisplayAniamlData() method. The format printed out could be a lot nicer and cleaner allowing for easier readability.
The most challenging part to me was the same method as above. I never got it to print as nice as the specs so i definitly need to work on my display skills. Though websites like youtube,cplusplus, and geeksforgeeks was a great help to my questions.
Going forward i would say being able to use multiple languages in a project will be a big help. Wether its future companies i work for or school i feel it will play a big role in my programming carrer.
